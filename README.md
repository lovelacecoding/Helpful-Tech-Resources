# Helpful Tech Resources
_Disclaimer: Please don't get stuck in 'tutorial hell'. Try to execute what you learned in a project or task of your own and then move on to the next interesting thing.<br>_

Over the last few months I spent a lot of time on social media, collecting all kinds of interesting, educational, and helpful resources. It was nearing the 100 links so I thought I would share them with the world, so here you go :) <br>
